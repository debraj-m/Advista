# Company News Scraper with Sentiment Analysis and Keyword Extraction

This project is a Python-based web scraper that fetches news headlines for a given company using Bing News. It then performs sentiment analysis on the headlines and extracts marketing-related keywords using Google's Gemini AI.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Fetches the latest news headlines from Bing News.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to determine if headlines are positive, negative, or neutral.
- **AI-powered Keyword Extraction**: Uses Google Gemini API to generate relevant marketing keywords from news headlines.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the results in a CSV file including sentiment scores and extracted keywords.

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed, then install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Enter the company name**
